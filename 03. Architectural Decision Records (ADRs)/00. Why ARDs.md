ADR stands for Architecture Decision Record.

It’s a small, lightweight Markdown file where you document important technical or architectural decisions you make during development — and why you made them. — and it’s one of the best habits you can build as a developer

📑 What ADRs Capture
Section	Meaning
Context	What problem you were solving
Decision	What you decided to do
Consequences	Pros, cons, trade-offs
Alternatives	What else you considered and why you didn’t choose it
Status	Is it proposed, accepted, or superseded by another ADR?
💬 Why ADRs Matter

ADRs are not about documentation bloat — they are just enough documentation to answer one question:

“Why did we do it that way?”

They help:

Future you understand why past-you made certain choices

New developers onboard faster

Teams discuss and record changes logically

Avoid re-debating old decisions
