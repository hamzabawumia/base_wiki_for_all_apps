ADR stands for Architecture Decision Record.

It’s a small, lightweight Markdown file where you document important technical or architectural decisions 
you make during development — and why you made them.
— and it’s one of the best habits you can build as a developer

# ADR 001: Use Django Signals for Payroll Updates

**Date:** 2025-11-08  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** [Your Name]  
**Tags:** [django, signals, payroll]

---

## Context
We need a way to trigger payroll recalculations whenever leave is approved.
Options considered included:
- Using a Celery background task
- Using a manual "Recalculate Payroll" button
- Using Django signals on the `LeaveApproval` model

## Decision
We will use **Django signals** to automatically handle payroll recalculations after a leave approval.

## Consequences
- ✅ Keeps data consistent in real-time  
- ✅ No need for extra scheduling infrastructure  
- ⚠️ Increases coupling between `LeaveApproval` and `Payroll` models

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Celery task:** More scalable, but adds unnecessary complexity right now.  
2. **Manual recalculation:** Prone to user error and data delays.
